I evaluated readily available pumps on Amazon.com, giving preference to 12V pumps over 6V/24V pumps so that there will be no need for voltage regulation. The desired pump characteristics were:

- 12V operation
- Pressure > 30PSI(~2bar/1500mm Hg)
- Cost < 25$
- Compact size (~ 3"x3"x3" or less)

Some of the pumps evaluated and reasons for failure:

- [Saim DC 12V](https://www.amazon.com/Saim-Motor-Aquarium-Oxygen-Circulate/dp/B0716V496V/ref=sr_1_9?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1521917975&sr=1-9&keywords=air+pump+12v) Cheap, compact, 12V but only 350mm HG Pressure
- [Keurig Replacement Mini Air Pump](https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-Replacement-Mini-U-S-SOLID/dp/B01BFNEVEQ/ref=sr_1_12?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1521917975&sr=1-12&keywords=air+pump+12v) Compact, 12V but only 350mm HG Pressure
- [Powerful DC 12V air pump ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LRWOFHS/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stppvp_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3467859002&pd_rd_wg=qcnwv&pf_rd_r=8PFF8GJZX18M2M89ZNWE&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-bottom-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B01LRWOFHS&pd_rd_w=UCCSl&pf_rd_i=air+pump+12v&pd_rd_r=7b88f504-cfa9-40d4-afc6-16a19a6dee1a&ie=UTF8&qid=1521918006&sr=2) ~5PSI

Multiple other candidates were also evaluated but the general trend was lack of pressure. Given that large tyre inflator type pumps are relatively low cost(<40$) it might be worth going the route of pneuduino and use a large **offboard pump** instead. This will **reduce portability significantly.**
